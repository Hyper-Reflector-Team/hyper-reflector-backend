This is just a simple list of commands i use on the server making note so I don't forget stuff.

-- adding a new user
adduser <name>
usermod -aG sudo <name>  -- this adds a user to the sudo group 


coturn stuff
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ9Jrxy6NVM&t=1561s&ab_channel=AwesomeOpenSource -- tutorial i used to set everything up

-- the coturn server should be always running on the main droplet this seems to be needed to be run on root only
systemctl restart coturn
systemctl status coturn -- check status


notes:
we should only run the backend services ie signal server from a user like (runner)
for some reason I cannot get git to work on any of the other users, likely an ssh issue or something going on with the droplet? 
I use root to do all of the installing stuff from git / pulling in the different user directories such as /home/runner is where im storing the BE now


-- pm2 stuff == more info here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSLhGanxmCg&ab_channel=HaykSimonyan
using pm2 as a process manager on runner
we have to install pm2 and bun globally 

pm2 start <filename>


-- security considerations
we should enable ufw to firewall all bad ports and connections
